ALERT !!!.

The last centos update (7.2.1511) came with an IPROUTE version which
breaks some neutron functions related to routers and networks. See
bug:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1528977

A patch is in the works, but, meanwhile you can just downgrade the
iproute package by issuing the following commands:

cd /tmp
wget http://vault.centos.org/7.1.1503/os/x86_64/Packages/iproute-3.10.0-21.el7.x86_64.rpm
yum -y downgrade ./iproute-3.10.0-21.el7.x86_64.rpm

And then, avoid yum to "update" the package by incluing in the "yum" exclude
list:

crudini --set /etc/yum.conf main exclude iproute

This is affecting Centos neutron packages 7.0.0-1 and 7.0.1-1. Eventually
OpenStack RDO maintainers will release a fixed version and you will need
to erase the "exclude" sentence in your /etc/yum.conf and update the
iproute package again.

NOTE: For your convenience, we included the "downgrade" iproute package in
the directory ./libs/iproute. That "just in case" you are unable to download
from the link in "vault.centos.org".
